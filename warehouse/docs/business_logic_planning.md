# Warehouse Service - Business Logic Planning

## 1. Warehouse Management Requirements

### Warehouse Registration and Information
- Warehouse registration with unique identification
- Warehouse location and contact information
- Warehouse type classification (distribution center, storage facility, etc.)
- Warehouse capacity and specifications
- Operating hours and availability
- Security and access control information
- Warehouse status (active, maintenance, closed, etc.)

### Warehouse Capacity and Storage
- Total storage capacity (weight and volume)
- Available storage space tracking
- Storage zones and sections
- Temperature-controlled areas
- Hazardous materials storage capabilities
- Loading and unloading facilities
- Storage equipment and infrastructure

### Warehouse Operations
- Incoming and outgoing cargo tracking
- Inventory management and stock levels
- Cargo placement and organization
- Loading and unloading operations
- Warehouse staff management
- Equipment maintenance and availability

## 2. Cargo Management Requirements

### Cargo Registration and Information
- Cargo identification and tracking numbers
- Cargo type classification (general, hazardous, perishable, etc.)
- Cargo specifications (weight, volume, dimensions)
- Cargo value and insurance information
- Special handling requirements
- Cargo status (received, stored, loading, shipped, etc.)

### Cargo Characteristics and Requirements
- Weight and volume specifications
- Temperature requirements
- Humidity requirements
- Special handling instructions
- Hazardous material classification
- Fragility and packaging requirements
- Storage duration and expiration dates

### Cargo Tracking and Status
- Cargo location within warehouse
- Movement history and tracking
- Status updates and notifications
- Damage reporting and claims
- Cargo inspection and quality control
- Loading and unloading timestamps

## 3. Cargo-Transport Compatibility Logic

### Compatibility Validation
- Weight capacity validation against vehicle specifications
- Volume capacity validation against vehicle dimensions
- Special requirements validation (temperature, hazardous materials)
- Route restrictions and vehicle capabilities
- Loading and unloading equipment compatibility
- Time constraints and delivery requirements

### Compatibility Scoring and Ranking
- Perfect match scoring (all requirements met)
- Partial match scoring (some requirements met)
- Risk assessment for non-ideal matches
- Cost implications of different vehicle types
- Priority-based assignment for premium cargo

### Compatibility Process
- Automatic compatibility checking for cargo-vehicle pairs
- Manual override for special cases
- Compatibility report generation
- Alternative vehicle suggestions
- Compatibility history and learning
