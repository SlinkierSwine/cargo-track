- Maintenance history and service records
- Insurance and registration expiration tracking
- Vehicle status (active, maintenance, retired, etc.)

### Vehicle Capacity and Capabilities
- Maximum cargo weight capacity
- Volume capacity (cubic meters)
- Special equipment (refrigeration, hazardous materials, etc.)
- Route restrictions (city center access, bridge weight limits)
- Fuel efficiency and range
- Operating costs per kilometer

## 2. Driver Management Requirements

### Driver Registration and Information

- Assignment confirmation and notification
- Route modification and reassignment
